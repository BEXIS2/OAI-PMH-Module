# BEXIS2 OAI-PMH Module

This module extends a BEXIS 2 instance with the functionality that BEXIS 2 works as a data provider for all harvesters according to the OAI-PMH protocol.

### Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)

The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers then make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP.
